# How To Review UI Kit Component

> Below is a checklist that organize specific criteria to validate across categories like composition, properties, behaviors and content.

1. Metadata
2. Composition — Base, slots, and nested components
3. Anatomy
4. Color styles
5. Text styles
6. Content
7. Spacing
8. Layout
9. Properties
10. Composition—Base, sub, and nested components
11. Behaviors


### 1. Metadata
As a designer, I can insert a component that’s precisely named and accurately described.[^1]

Item | Type | Description
:--- |:--- |:---
1.1 | **Name** | Is it named consistently with the code?
1.2 | **Description** | Is it described sufficiently, such as with a component introduction from Aether documentation?
1.3 | **Status** | Is status up-to-date, such as stability (Soon-to-be-removed, Experimental, Beta or …)?
1.4 | **Page Title Links** | Is linked correctly with the Usage Guidelines and Code Documentation?


### 2. Anatomy
As a designer, I want to interact with a well-organized and cleanly built component anatomy to find and adjust elements as needed.[^2]

Item | Type | Description
:--- |:--- |:---
2.1 | **Name** | Are layer names consistent with the specified component anatomy?
2.2 | **Name** | Are layer names formatted as actual names in sentence case, not “Frame ###”?
2.3 | **Name** | Are naming conventions applied, such as using space between (]-[) for layers?
2.4 | **Name** | Are nested components named descriptively?
2.5 | **Name** | Are layers shown or hidden appropriately, including layers within hidden layers?

### 3. Color styles
As a designer, the component applies colors via color styles and component-specific attributes in a manner consistent with design tokens.[^3]

Item | Type | Description
:--- |:--- |:---
3.1 | **Name** | Are 
3.2 | **Name** | Are 
3.3 | **Name** | Are 
3.4 | **Name** | Are 
3.5 | **Name** | Are 

### 4. Text styles
As a designer, the component applies system typography via text styles and component-specific overrides so that I don’t have to style text.[^4]

Item | Type | Description
:--- |:--- |:---
4.1 | **Name** | Are 
4.2 | **Name** | Are
